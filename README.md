### Hello! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Lena, a passionate student delving into the exciting world where data and design intersect.

My passion for art and philosophy has always defined me, leading me to explore creativity, critical thinking, and the profound human experience.

This journey evolved into a deep appreciation for design, a medium like art, for storytelling and evoking emotions.

Driven by curiosity, I ventured into research, exploring the intersections of ideas, culture, and human behavior to shape the world.

Today, I've found my calling in product design, merging my artistic sensibilities, philosophical curiosity, and research skills to create user-centric solutions.

My fervor lies in using design to innovate, crafting products that meet needs and inspire wonder.

I'm now on a data-focused journey, aiming to merge data and design in exciting ways. Thank you for joining me on this creative adventure.
