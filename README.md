## Hello! ðŸ‘‹ Lena here!

 I'm a design technologist and current grad student specializing in data analytics and visualization. My passion is at the intersection of design and data, driven by a background in art and philosophy, which influences my approach to user-friendly product design. I'll be sharing my projects here as they are completed. Thanks for visiting!
