### Hello! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Lena, a passionate student delving into the exciting world where data and design intersect.

My interest in art and philosophy has driven me to explore creativity, critical thinking, and the human experience. This led me to appreciate design as a way to tell stories and delve into research, examining the connections between ideas, culture, and human behavior.

I've discovered my passion in product design, where I combine design and research to make user-friendly solutions. I'm excited to explore the connection between data and design as I continue my studies in data analytics & visualizations.
